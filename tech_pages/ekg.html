            Note: Due to equipment limitations, we soldered my partner’s PCB in the lab. However, each of us independently designed and had our own PCB boards separately.
        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to design an electronic system capable of measuring a person’s heartbeat, resulting in a DIY EKG circuit. 
                To achieve this, we worked with industry-standard tools such as Cadence and Altium to better understand the full PCB development process.
                We began with circuit simulation and testing in Cadence, then moved on to PCB design in Altium before sending the boards out for fabrication. 
                Through this process, we gained hands-on experience with SMD soldering, real-world testing using our own heartbeats, and ongoing validation 
                to ensure the circuit functioned accurately and safely.
            </p>

            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p>
                The project process was divided into three main stages: simulation, design, and testing. We began in Cadence by simulating the key parts of 
                the EKG circuit, including T-notch filters to reduce unwanted noise and a DRL circuit to strengthen the heartbeat signal. During this stage, 
                we experimented with different component values and tested how each change affected the signal to make sure the circuit behaved as expected. 
                We also simulated other essential components such as instrumentation amplifiers and high-pass filters to further clean and amplify the signal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the simulations were working reliably, we moved to Altium to design the PCB based on our tested circuit. In Altium, we conducted basic 
                market research on available components and selected parts that were both affordable and reliable by reviewing their datasheets. After choosing 
                the individual components, we routed and connected them on the board and poured the appropriate conductive layers. Altium’s 3D view also allowed 
                us to check component placement and verify that everything was positioned and connected correctly before manufacturing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After finalizing the design, the boards were sent to a manufacturer for fabrication. Once we received the PCBs, we began soldering the surface-mount 
                components. Working with a partner, we took turns practicing SMD soldering and testing the circuit using oscilloscopes and our own heartbeats to 
                validate the design in real-world conditions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2>The Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                Although my partner’s board had routing issues that were difficult to fix after fabrication, the project was still a valuable learning experience. 
                Through circuit simulation in Cadence and PCB design in Altium, I gained a strong understanding of the full electronics workflow, from concept to manufacturing. 
                I especially enjoyed the SMD soldering process and learning how to troubleshoot issues that could be addressed after fabrication. Testing the circuit with 
                oscilloscopes and real heartbeat signals helped connect theory to real-world behavior, and the experience gave me a deeper appreciation for PCB manufacturing 
                constraints, component selection, and the importance of careful validation throughout the design process.
